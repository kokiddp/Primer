# Primer
python tools for prime numbers research and experiments

at current state the script finds all the primes up to a certain number.
output is displayed on screen and saved to output.txt



fist at all the script tries to load input.txt, which should contain a list of prime numbers
this allows to speed research up (quite a lot)

i strongly suggest to generate a txt file with prime numbers up to something big (let's say 100kk or a bilion) and then rename it to input.txt

this procedure will significantly make research faster while n <= (biggest prime in input.txt)^2
